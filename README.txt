This is an app that calculates the carbon emissions of a user's transportation by using life
cycle assessment (LCA) approach which incorporates the user's location data as the user input. 
Alternatively, the user can input their own desired location for the originated location input.
The app requires minimal input from the user, such as a single destination input request,
which then calculates the carbon footprint of several transportation modes for the distance covered.
The life cycle approach is also applicable to many areas, like emissions from home appliances, 
carbon footprint of food stored on the fridge, etc. LCA approach can be beneficial for future IOT technologies.
